# In math, we call a natural number prime if it's greater than 1 and can be divided without any remainder
# only by 1 and itself:

# 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...

# Create a list of all prime numbers up to 1000 in the code below. Just save this list into a variable
# prime_numbers, you don't have to print anything.

# Make use of any() or all() to check if a number n leaves a zero remainder when divided by values
# # from 2 to n - 1 (inclusively).
